## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned that `align-items` & `justify-content` only work for `display: flex`

I learned to use `rem` for sizing instead of `%` everywhere.

I learned that `padding` also helps with getting the required size.

### Continued development

I still need to practice the positioning an element more. I also need to learn about CSS in general & HTML5 rules.
